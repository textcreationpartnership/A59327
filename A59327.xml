            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Character and Figure You bear in the World, has ſo markt You out for Sufferings of this Kind, that I beſeech you to take it as a Perſecution You were born to. 'Tis enough You attract all Eyes, and fix an Univerſal Veneration, and have ſo far got the ſtart of the reſt of the generous Perſuers of Your own fair Chace of Honour, that (tho without a Title) I may truly ſay this of You, that You carry the Renown and Grandeur of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, to that uncommon Height, that <hi>Nobility</hi> itſelf ſhould it ſet out with You, would be thrown out of the Race and lag behind You. Nor has Your Port and Bravery more dazled, than your Juſtice and Goodneſs indear'd, and the Sweetneſs of your Temper and Converſation charm'd; inſomuch, that, betwixt ſuch various Objects of our equal Admiration, you have even reconciled at once the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Envy and the Love of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. You are ſo much Maſter of a truly noble Genius, that you have all the Glory of a Second <hi>Timon,</hi> without the Follies and Vanities of the Firſt. And indeed You challenge thoſe United Graces of Gallantry, that like Heaven's faireſt Union, <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> warm where they ſhine.</p>
            <p>But Providence pours not ſuch <hi>Golden Showres</hi> at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſo vaſt the Difference betwixt the Gifts and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:97667:3"/>of Heaven; and 'tis poſſibly Your own peculiar fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glory to <hi>deſerve</hi> firſt, and then <hi>poſſeſs.</hi> For above all You have that nobleſt Foundation of Honour, <hi>Virtue;</hi> a Flower not always ſo ripe in ſo young a Garden; that <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>ſolid</hi> Maſs of <hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>Principle,</hi> that Your Afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Worldly Bleſſings have not ſmiled more kindly round You, than that has enricht you within; inſomuch that You have, at leaſt, this Advantage of the <hi>Great</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining <hi>Alexander,</hi>

            <p>that on the contrary you give the World a ſufficient View of the laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any Allay or Cloud from the firſt.</p>
            <p>But after Your Pardon firſt beg'd for this Boldneſs. I ought to tell the World, that I make not this Addreſs under the Name of a Dedication: Some worthier Product, and fairer Volume may cover that Honour. No, Sir, this poor Trifle is only thrown into Your Hands <hi>en paſſant;</hi> and the only encouragement for this Preſumption is, that I conſider that he that preſents but a Roſe bud may expreſs as much Zeal, as he that offers a Garland, which is the beſt Apology for,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Honourable</hi> and <hi>Learned Athenians</hi> (Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes how juſtly their due, the following Heraldry will a little blazon) have ſo long and ſo highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged the World, that with a natural and ſo far pardonable Pride, that commonly attends the Glory of Well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſeem reſolved to continue there more than <hi>Saturnine</hi> Progreſs, in that unfiniſht Circle, as ſhall laſt to the <hi>Great Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick.</hi> And if <hi>praeſtat nihili quam nihil agere</hi> may make a Gem in their Coronet, the great <hi>Indefeſſus agendo,</hi> is truly the <hi>Athenian</hi> peculiar Prerogative.</p>
            <p>But not to light a Candle at noon day, and play the Panegyriſt on the <hi>Athenian</hi> Learning, already ſo known and ſo conſpicuous, 'tis not the <hi>Apollinary</hi> Arts, but the <hi>Apolloes</hi> themſelves the <hi>Arts-maſters</hi> we are to ſearch for; the <hi>Phoebi in nubibus,</hi> that have thus long tun'd their Lyres for the Titillation of Mortals, ſo raviſhing the Muſick, and yet ſo inviſible the hands that play it. Ay my Master's inviſible indeed. But whatever <hi>Shamefacedneſs,</hi> or to ſhorten the word whatever <hi>Athenian Shame</hi> has denied Mankind the Favoar of that Diſcovery, 'tis pity the world ſhould be ſo vaſtly indebted, and know not where to pay their Acknowledgments. For really in this wiſer Age it
<pb facs="tcp:97667:4"/>looks ſo ungratefully to build Altars <hi>to the Unknown,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing poſſibly can be of more public ſervice than to direct the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto wandring popular Devotion, no longer random'd, but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd at ſo fair a Mark.</p>
            <p>'Tis true our generous <hi>Athenians</hi> have lately vouchſafed to give us ſome ſmall Lineaments of theirs in <hi>Miniature,</hi> in a Sculp before their <hi>Young Students Library.</hi> But there alas, they are pleaſed to wrap their Faces in <hi>Moſaic Veils,</hi> very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially intimating that they are Perſons that daily converſe ſo near with <hi>Divinity,</hi> that their <hi>ſhining Faces</hi> are too dazling for humane View, and therefore no leſs kindly than modeſtly, thus like <hi>Bays</hi> his <hi>Morning pictur'd in a Cloud.</hi> I confeſs Mr. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graver has made a pretty Jolly Company of 'em: but there indeed the <hi>Painter</hi> is a little too <hi>poetical;</hi> and our <hi>Athenians</hi> have a little ſtrain'd a point: For when the true <hi>Muſter Roll</hi> of that not overnumerous Society ſhall be examined, for ſupply of that defect, you muſt conſider that the <hi>Veil'd Faces</hi> are by way of <hi>

               <p>Now Gentlemen to the Queſtion, the Nobler Animal — Look you [Noble] is a high and honourable Epithete, a word of Altitude, as I may ſo ſay. <hi>A</hi> Man, or indeed any other ſublunary Creature may be ſtiled Noble, in two ſeveral ſenſes. Firſt, in his perſonal Capacity, and ſecondly in his Extract and Original. As to the perſonal capacity of theſe 2 Animals propoſed in the Queſtion—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Daſh.</speaker>
               <p>Hold Brother, the deciſion of that point is my Province. As to their perſonal capacities this I muſt ſay, ſince Nature either has not furniſht theſe two Animals with Bulk and Dimenſion ſuitable to their extraordinary Figure and Symmetry, or rather has not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht our narrow, ſighted humane Opticks with ſufficient perſpicacity to diſtinguiſh the extraordinary parts, lineaments and corporeal accompliſhments of the ſaid animals in their due perfection, I have a little Mathematical Inſtrument, a ſmall piece of art in my pocket, that has diſcover'd moſt prodigious phenomenons in the corporeal qualifications of the ſaid minute animals: and let me tell you, there's exactly as much difference between a Louſe and a Flea, as between an Elephant and a Rhinoceros.</p>

               <p>Nay; I have ſo accurately ſurvey'd and delineated the Proboſcis of the one, and the Cuſp or Horne of the other, both ſo plain, and indeed ſo amazing. For experiment ſake, Friend <hi>Jerry,</hi> have you ever a—</p>

If you are for Genealogies and Nativity, pray take the great birth of the little <hi>Polypus,</hi> the Louſe, into your grave conſideration. Do you think 'tis not as high an honour to his Veins to have the vital warmth of Man for his Parent; that <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> or at leaſt Lord of the World, nay, himſelf a World; that more than Miſcrocoſm, Man, for his Sire.</p>

               <p>No, Gentlemen, all that has already been ſaid are weak arguments in the Great Cauſe depending. Alas, conſider, my Learned Friends, that we ſit here for more important work, and ſublimer contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations. You forget ſure that the main Great End of our Debates and Reſults is the Encouragement of true Religion, Virtue and Piety; and the ſuppreſſion of Vanity, Vice and Profaneneſs. And perhaps never was a fairer Topick of that kind came before us than in theſe two ſmall animals now in controverſie. For inſtance, what is the Flea but apetfect image or portraict of Prodigality, nay the Prodigal himſelf, that very unprovidently, like the Graſhopper, only hops and dances in Summer, and famiſhes and ſtarves in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Nay, what's yet a greater blot in his Scutcheon for <hi>(dic qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscum ſis, &amp; dicam quis es)</hi> he herds and ſociates with Dogs, when on the contrary, the braver-ſpirited Louſe conſorts with Men, and not only ſo, but is the perfect Emblem of the provident good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; is no Rover, nor Rambler, but carefully keeps home, will lodge ſnug in the Collar of a Doublet (unleſs diſturb'd by the hard hand of <hi>Philiſtines</hi>) there perform the firſt great Commandment, <hi>Increaſe and Multiply,</hi> and be the ſtaid and carefull Father of a Family even to the fifth and ſixth Generation.</p>

               <p>Well Brother, you have ſpoken with the Voice of an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The Defence of Religion and Virtue, Morals and Principle as thou obſerveſt, are our grand affair, and accordingly we ſubſcribe to your deep Judgment, The Louſe the nobler animal; beſides I could add one mite more into the Scale of the Louſe to out ballance his weaker Rival the Flea. The Flea, with ſubmiſſion, is a perfect. Blood ſucker, and lives in open violation of the <hi>Moſaie</hi> Law.</p>

               <p>Ay, and had like to have carry'd her, only the ſilly old woman broke off the Match. For when we came to the great Matrimonial preliminary the matter of Money, the penurious ſtingy old fool was for having me take out her daughters whole portion in Tripe and Trotters; which ſubſtantial houſhold geer, though Heaven knows I love very well, yet I was for ſome ready Cole, and could by no means diſpence with all Sowce and no Silver.</p>

Very pretty Injunction, when the bare triviall Requeſt of a Scrupulous Parent (for that was the Parents utmoſt power) could be of force ſufficient to ſuperſede the higher obligations of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Chriſtianity in four Orthodox (or indeed ſuppoſe but one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle one) profeſſors of Religion and Preachers of the Goſpel, to be ſo much Traytors to their God (for that's their beſt name) that not one of 'em from that day to this has ſo much as open'd his mouth, (nay and that too in ſo Atheſticall an Age) to the atteſting that ſingle ſhort nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of this anonimous <hi>Spira's</hi> dreadfull Example, tho' poſſibly to a much greater Service to their Church then the whole Pulpit work of half an Age.</p>

               <p>By your ſweet Leave Sirs, I come from a very honeſt Gentleman, who deſires to Communicate ſome ſmall Affairs to your Honourable Society.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, and a learned one too. A man of Senſe as well as Honor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Grub.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Grub.</speaker>
               <p>Enough Enough, I need no other proofs of his Learning. His Senſe and Parts are unqueſtionable. For as our Brother <hi>Bays</hi> ſays of his Play, So we make our Mercury our Touchſtone: He that is our <hi>Athenian</hi> Admirer, gives a ſufficient Indication of all the accompliſhments both of a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity needs no fairer a Teſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Yes Sir you'l find him in the firſt Columne of your Mercury of the 9th. of <hi>May</hi> laſt, throwing down a ſmall gauntlet of his in your quarrell by way of Challenge to an impudent anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Adverſary of yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Grub.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, I remember that Honourable Friend of ours, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd <hi>T. W.</hi> that ſent us the kind Letter in Vindication of a ſmall Couplet of mine in one of our Mercurys, againſt an Attacque of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Ignorance, under the Imputation and Charge of Blaſphemy.</p>

               <p>Ay, and ſome overwiſe ſnarlers forſooth, were pleas'd to Criticiſe upon that laſt line as no leſs then a Blaſphemous Reflection upon Gods Omniſcience, as if he could be Ignorant of a common Naturall Cauſe and Effect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Grub.</speaker>
               <p>O beyond all Expreſſion. For my part I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his learned Arguments even with a ſort of Veneration. How do's he lay our feeble Adverſarys upon their Backs? as if every Hypotheticall Expreſſion (as they fooliſhly ſuggeſt Heav'n help their weakneſs) muſt imply a Negative. Well but that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman has produced ſuch Arguments and cited ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to clear that point as nothing could make a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Defence for us, nor more ſubſtantiall Juſtification.</p>
               <p>For Inſtance,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Si Deus est animus nobis ut carmina dicunt,</l>

               </q>
               <p>As if ſays he either the ſuppos'd Heathen Authour <hi>Cato,</hi> or rather the true Chriſtian Authour <hi>Franciſcus de Sta. Clara</hi> could be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doubting wheither God was a Spirit or no.</p>
               <p>And in another Inſtance,</p>
               <q>Frigida ſi ſit Hyems cur aquae fumant hyemales.</q>
               <p>As if (continues he) that Famous and memorable Authour and Phyſitian <hi>Johannes Nubrigenſis</hi> ſo renoun'd in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> could doubt wheither winter was cold or no; becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth thus Hypothetically expreſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>But pray Gentlemen by the by are you of my Freinds Opinion that <hi>Franciſcus de Sta. Clara</hi> an eminent Chriſtian Monck, in the 12th. <hi>Century,</hi> was the true Authour of thoſe diſticks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>Sententiae Pueriles,</hi> and not the reputed Heathen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt <hi>Cato.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Grub.</speaker>
               <p>Ay no doubt on't: I could have reſolv'd you that twice ſeven Years agoe. For thoſe Famous Authours your freind quotes for his Authority <hi>viz. Joachim Crinitus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſhmole &amp;c.</hi> the one that aſſerts it in his <hi>Diſſertationes de Crit. fid. Chriſt.</hi> and the other in his <hi>Chymia Sacra,</hi> are both of 'em writers of unqueſtion'd Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, and both my particular Cloſet Freinds and Acquaintance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Then you have read both thoſe Authours?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Grub.</speaker>
               <p>through and through, pith and marrow, nerve and ſinew; as for <hi>Joachimus</hi> I'le ſay that for him, I do not beleive that there's ever a ſchool caſuiſt of 'em all mootes Points of Conſcience like him. Between Freinds, I have accommodated my ſelf with many an Anſwer to ſome knotty points of Religion in ſeveral of our Mercurys, from that very Authour. No diſparagement, I hope Sir, to borrow from the Learned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>O, fye Sir, diſparagement! rather your Glory, Sir, to have that Honourable truſt and familiarity with the Keys and

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Grub.</speaker>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Aſhmole,</hi> that more modern Engliſh Pen, I am of opinion that nothing has made ſo Elaborate an Extraction of the quinteſſence and ſpirit of Divinity as his <hi>Chymia Sacra</hi> have done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Squirt.</speaker>
               <p>Nay now you talk of Your Two learned <hi>Mephiſtophilos</hi> and <hi>Familiars,</hi> pray let me thruſt in one word of my particular Cloſet-Mate and Croney too, the worthy <hi>Joannes Nubrigenſis,</hi> I aſſure you Sir I have ſo much Reaſon to be deep in his Books, that I can vouch that for the Honour of old <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>'s days, that that very <hi>Eſculapius</hi> of never dying Memory, was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Founder of my <hi>Tetrachymagogon.</hi> Not but I have built and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved upon his Baſis. And not but a young Cook may add one corne of ſalt, and one grain of ſpice to an old ſtanding Pye, But in ſhort the Original Diſh is all his own, and poſſibly 'tis no ſmall feather in my Cap that the Care and Induſtry of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, have preſerved that golden Arcanum hallow'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable for ſo many ſucceſſive Ages, and lodged it wholly and ſolely in my hands.</p>
